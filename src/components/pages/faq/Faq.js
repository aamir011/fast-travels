                            Direct flights may land to the airports only for the
                            refuelling purpose and donâ€™t allow the passengers to
                            go out to roam. Liked flights are meant to stay on
                            the other airports come in a way and allow
                            passengers to go out of the plan and take rest on
                            the airport, these types of flights are somehow
                            cheap. Non-stop flights are the directly destined
                            flights with no stops even for refuelling. Yes, in

                            do with the airlines and they set the time and date
                            of the flights. It is up to the ease of our
                            customers that how they want to travel.

                            No. Last-minute reservation is not a good idea. If
                            you are thinking to go for one, the tickets will be
                            high priced and often not available. So better is to
                            go to reserve your tickets months or a few weeks ago
                            at least.
