and 90 minutes for domestic flights. Remember to reconfirm your return flight booking
before 72 hours of traveling.
Remember, if you don’t reconfirm your flight, you may miss your flight because it will be
terminated by the time. It is common with the popular airlines that they mostly get the right
of canceling the whole bookings. Again, Fast Travels, as a third party is not responsible for any

the rational assistance they require via our customer service center. Our recommendation for
our customers is to please recheck and reconfirm for your reserved seats before flying.

that you will get the exact seats you booked for, it is a matter between you and the airline
you booked your seats with. We are not responsible for any cost of any transmissions
between airports and stations. It is for your information that the flights you booked at good
fares may not be the direct flights, so don’t worry it happens. Sometimes It is technically

your flight will not be ATOL protected. Flight package: Where we sell a flight package as

with the services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You
agree to accept that in those circumstances, the alternative ATOL holder will perform those
obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your
contract to that alternative ATOL holder. However, you also agree that in some cases it will
not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to
make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable). If we, or
the suppliers identified on your ATOL certificate, are unable to provide the services listed (or
a suitable alternative, through an alternative ATOL holder or otherwise) for reasons of
insolvency, the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust may make a payment to (or confer a benefit
on) you under the ATOL scheme. You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit you
assign absolutely to those Trustees any claims which you have or may have arising out of or

ATOL scheme. Non-flight package: Where we act as agent for a package organized by a
third party, we will advise you of the financial protection arranged by the organizer in the
case of the organizer’s insolvency. We are only responsible for arranging financial protection

                                        <h4 style={{ margin: '18px 0px 5px', color: "#014587", fontSize: "1.5em" }}>a) Your contract</h4>
                                        <p>Your contract will either be with Fast Travels/ Eden International LTD or another travel supplier depending on what travel product/s or service/s you book. When you book a package or a hotel only booking which we sell as principal (see explanation above at paragraph 3 (d) above) your contract will be with Fast Travels/ Eden International LTD. A ‘package’ is a pre-arranged combination of at least two of the following:</p>
                                        <p>(a) transport</p>
                                        <p>(b) accommodation or</p>
                                        <p>(c) another tourist service forming a significant part of your booking and those two or more components are sold to you as a whole at the same time by us at an inclusive price with full payment being made to us</p>
                                        <p>Your credit card will be charged for the full amount of your Fast Travels/ Eden International LTD package at the time of booking. You may have separate credit card charges for each product in the package, totaling the amount quoted for your package.
                                            If you book a low cost flight with us, which are flights with a low cost airline which is shown by the logo on our website, we will make the booking as your agent and your contract for your low cost flight will be additionally subject to the airline’s terms and conditions which could limit or exclude liability to you (often in accordance with various applicable international conventions). If your booking is not a package or accommodation which we sell as principal, Fast Travels/  Eden International LTD will make the booking on your behalf as a booking agent for the relevant Supplier’s concerned and your contract will be subject to the Supplier’s terms and conditions which could limit or exclude liability to you (often in accordance with various applicable international conventions). If you wish to review the relevant Supplier’s terms, we refer you to the links section of our website where the Supplier’s terms will be available through a link. In instances where it is not possible to access the Supplier’s terms by a link, we will provide the Supplier’s contact details so that you may contact them. Alternatively, you should visit the relevant Supplier’s official website. Please ensure you refer to the applicable Supplier’s terms and conditions for cancellation charges and other important terms and conditions relevant to your car rental.
                                            Your holiday will not be a package if you, or our travel advisors on your behalf, put together two or more different and individually priced types of products or services and where you book these products at the same time for one total price. In these circumstances your contract will be with the relevant third party Supplier. Fast Travels/ Eden International LTD will be acting as agent for the Supplier and is not a party to the contractual relationship. Again, you will be additionally subject to the Supplier’s terms and conditions which could limit or exclude liability to you (often in accordance with various applicable international conventions).
                                            Your contract will come into existence once we have received your payment in cleared funds and a confirmation invoice has been issued. Prices are confirmed at the final step of the booking path at the point when you click ‘Agree and purchase’. Prices are shown with rates of exchange calculated on a daily basis. Prices, including sterling (GBP) price estimates, may therefore differ on a daily basis to reflect any movement in exchange rate levels. When a booking is made the exchange rate will be fixed at the time the item is created and will apply to any amendments or cancellations to that item within the booking. Exchange rates are determined by Fast Travels/ Eden International LTD. These booking conditions apply to all bookings (including those where we act only as agent) except where otherwise specified. Please note that a Fast Travels/ Eden International LTD booking fee may be applicable which is a maximum of £30 per person depending upon whether you book on our website or via our call centre and depending upon which product you book. You will be advised of any fee before you confirm your reservation. An additional charge of 1.5% of the total booking value may be charged for all products purchased from Fast Travels/  Fast Travels/ Eden International LTD (excluding hotel bookings where payment is made at the hotel and excluding air fares where payment is taken by carrier) when you pay. This amount will always be shown prior to payment being taken and will be a maximum of £30 per booking.
                                            We reserve the right to cancel your booking in the event we have reasonable grounds to believe it is fraudulent. In such circumstances we will attempt to contact you using the email address you provided at the time of booking or your bank. In the event we are not able to contact you or your bank, we may cancel your booking with no liability whatsoever. All Fast Travels/ Eden International LTD fees can be changed at any time. This includes telesales, cancel, change, payment card or other fees. Such fees can be reduced, increased or removed at any time.

                                        <p>The information in this section is valid for British Citizens only. Non-British Citizens (including: citizens of British Dependent Territories; those who hold their citizenship by virtue of a connection with Gibraltar; British subjects who have a right of abode in the United Kingdom; and EC and other nationals) should consult the Embassy of their destination country and the Home Office Immigration Department regarding any special documentation for the countries they are visiting or for return to the UK. It is your responsibility to check with the applicable Embassy or Consulate to see whether the destination(s) that you are visiting requires a visa, especially if you do not hold a passport marked “British Citizen”. If you fail to do so, you will be solely responsible for any cost, loss or damage which you or we incur as a result of your failure. It is also important to remember to include all transit points of your journey, which may also require you to obtain a visa. Please note that many countries require that your passport is valid for six months beyond the period of your stay. Some countries apply different rules and you should contact the Embassy or Consulate of your destination for relevant current information.
                                            It is vital that you ensure that your passport is legible and intact, any sign of damage could result in a refusal of carriage or entry into your country of destination. If you hold a UK passport and require information in respect of the validity of your passport, procedure and time required to apply for a passport or renew an existing passport, the regulations in respect of minors, or if your passport has been lost or stolen, you can contact the UK Passport Service help line on 0870 521 0410 or on the internet at www.ukpa.gov.uk
                                            It is your responsibility to obtain the appropriate visa for your destination(s) and any applicable transit point. If you require information in respect of current visa requirements, procedure and time required to apply for the applicable visa, you should contact the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Their telephone number is 020 7008 8438 and their website address is www.fco.gov.uk. Please note that specific requirements for specific countries can be complex and subject to change at short notice.
                                            Children not already included on a valid British passport will need to hold their own passport if they are to travel abroad. Children who were included on a passport before 5 October 1998 may continue to travel with the passport holder until:
                                            The child reaches the age of 16 years; or
                                            The passport on which the child is included expires; or
                                            The passport on which the child is included is replaced or an amendment results in the issue of a new passport
                                            The name on the passport must match the name on the ticket, otherwise you may not be able to travel and insurance may be invalid. If, after booking a holiday but before travelling, any member of your party changes their name, e.g. as a result of getting married, we must be notified immediately so that we can endeavor to make the necessary changes to your holiday documentation.If you are travelling to or via the United States and if you come from a country that is part of the Visa Exemption Programme, from 12 January 2009 the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) replaces the form that has until now been completed on the plane. If you travel to the USA from 12 January 2009, it is essential that you complete and print the ESTA form before you travel in order to receive travel authorization.
                                            You must take this travel authorization with you when you travel. If you do not have this document or if it is invalid, the airline may refuse to allow you to board the aircraft.
                                            The form must be filled out at the latest 72 hours prior to departure, but it is recommended that you complete it as soon as you plan your journey.
                                            This procedure applies to adults and children (whatever their age). The information requested includes passport number and country of residence.
                                            In most cases, electronic travel authorization is granted online almost immediately by specifying “authorization approved”. It is valid for a period of two years or until expiry of the passport.
                                            You should seek advice on any vaccinations and precautions that may be compulsory or recommended from a health professional – a GP, practice nurse, pharmacist or travel health clinic – ideally at least 8 weeks before you travel. Further travel advice can be found on www.fitfortravel.scot.nhs.uk and www.nathnac.org. Information about how to get medical treatment abroad and how to get reduced cost, and sometimes free treatment in Europe can be found in the NHS leaflet “Health Advice for Travelers”.
